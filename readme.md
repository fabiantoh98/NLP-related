# Self Learn NLP

This is a set of Jupyter notebook that I used to experiment hugging face API to understand how NLP and basic LLM model works.

I follow closely to the step by step guide by hugging face and change some of the examples to my own one.


## Brief Explanation

- NLP-HF-lesson-1.ipynb - compilation of code based on lesson 1
- NLP-HF-lesson-2.ipynb - compilation of code based on lesson 2
- NLP-HF-lesson-3.ipynb - compilation of code based on lesson 3
- NLP-HF-lesson-4.ipynb - compilation of code based on lesson 4
- NLP-HF-lesson-5.ipynb - compilation of code based on lesson 5
- NLP-HF-lesson-6.ipynb - compilation of code based on lesson 6

Lesson 7 Guide on on each of the NLP task so instead of compiling it into a single notebook i have decided to split it up.
Each notebook in NLP-HF-lesson-7 is a type of NLP application

Feel free to use this repo if you want.

Thank you!
