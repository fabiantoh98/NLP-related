# Self Learn NLP

This is a set of Jupyter notebook that I used to experiment hugging face API to understand how NLP and basic LLM model works.

I follow closely to the step by step guide by hugging face and change some of the examples to my own one.

Feel free to use this repo if you want.

Thank you!
